The programs provide the sufficient statistic, the point estimator, the test statistic, the goodness of fit, the confidence inteval, and one-way analysis of continuous bernoulli distribution. Of course, we extend to **continuous binomial distribution** and **continuous trinomial distribution**.

## Free book

For the mathematic derivation, you can read the pdf of free book on [Free-ebook.net](https://www.free-ebooks.net/computer-sciences-textbooks/Continuous-Bernoulli-distribution-simulator-and-test-statistic). 

### Book's contents
##### Chapter 1, The Continuous Bernoulli distribution
##### Chapter 2, The sufficient statistic of Continuous Bernoulli distribution
##### Chapter 3, The point estimator of Continuous Bernoulli distribution
##### Chapter 4, The test statistic of Continuous Bernoulli distribution
##### Chapter 5, The confidence interval of Continuous Bernoulli distribution
##### Chapter 6, The test statistic and confidence interval of two Continuous Bernoulli populations
##### Chapter 7, Goodness of fit about Continuous Bernoulli distribution
##### Chapter 8, One way analysis when population is Continuous Bernoulli distribution
##### Chapter 9, The Continuous Trinomial distribution and trial number=1
##### Chapter 10, The Continuous Trinomial distribution and trial number=n

## computer programs

### Content

There are 13 computer programs to compute the probability distribution and testing and confidence interval, those can help reader to get the probability distribution and do the statistical analysis. 

There are two documents, simple and detailed descriptions, of the computer programs in the document folder.

The codes and exe files are in the code_and_exe folder.

### download location
* folder name: code_and_exe
* folder name: document

### Install

Since the exe files have to run in C:\C_Bernoulli, drop the exe files into C:\C_Bernoulli. Then click the exe file to run.

### Usage

The programs contains the simulator of probability distribution(1-4), the statistic analysis(5-12), and the probability distribution after transformation(13). For example,

1. run C:\C_Bernoulli\C_Bernoulli_01.exe

2. run C:\C_Bernoulli\C_Bernoulli_02.exe
