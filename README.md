# book and computer program

The programs provide the sufficient statistic, the point estimator, the test statistic, the goodness of fit, the confidence inteval, and one-way analysis of continuous bernoulli distribution. Of course, we extend to **continuous binomial distribution** and **continuous trinomial distribution**.

## Free book

For the mathematic derivation, you can read the pdf of free book on [Free-ebook.net](https://www.free-ebooks.net/computer-sciences-textbooks/Continuous-Bernoulli-distribution-simulator-and-test-statistic).

## computer programs

### Content

There are 13 computer programs to compute the probability distribution and testing and confidence interval, those can help reader to get the probability distribution and do the statistical analysis. 

### download location
* folder name: code_and_exe
* folder name: document

### Install
1. the exe files have to run in C:\C_Bernoulli
2. put the exe files in C:\C_Bernoulli
3. click the exe file to run.

### Usage
The programs contains the simulator of probability distribution(1-4), the statistic analysis(5-12), and the probability distribution after transformation(13). For example,

1. run C:\C_Bernoulli\C_Bernoulli_01.exe
